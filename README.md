Pattern For building ML models :

Data Analysis<br>
Feature Engineering<br>
Satandardization<br>
Model Building<br>
Predictions<br>

Features : 

Malaria detection , Covid-19 detection and Pre-cancerous lesions detection :

Using openCV to detect images of disease and usage of CNN / Conv net model for disease
prediction .

Steps for building Conv net : Convolution Operation<br>
ReLU Layer (Rectified Linear Unit)<br>
Pooling Layer (Max Pooling)<br>
Flattening<br>
Fully Connected Layer<br>


Face Mask Detection :

Caffe model is the pre-trained deep learning model used to detect faces.

For Face mask detection I have used pre-trained keras CNN model .

OpencV is used to detect faces and CNN model to classify if mask is present or not .


Mental Health :

Usage of KNN , SVC , Logistic Regression , Decision tree , Random forest , Naive Bayes etc for
prediction of Mental health .

Ability of user to choose between different classifiers and tune the parameters to check how it affects the result .

Attempt to raise awareness about importance of mental health and issues faced by employees.
